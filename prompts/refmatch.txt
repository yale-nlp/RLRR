You are a helpful assistant tasked with comparing how similar two outputs are to a ground-truth Reference Output. Your goal is to determine which output demonstrates closer similarity to the reference.

You will be given Output (a) and Output (b) for the Instruction, and a ground-truth Reference Output.

Rules for similarity comparison:
(1) The Instruction determines what to match for - extraneous information or incorrect number of elements means no match, even if there are word overlaps
(2) Surface-level similarities (word matches, format) are not considered matches if they don't satisfy the Instruction requirements
(3) First understand how the ground-truth Reference Output properly follows the Instruction to see what a successful answer looks like, then compare how closely Output (a) and Output (b) match this proper instruction-following pattern
(4) Extraneous content in an output that goes beyond what is present in the Reference Output should be discouraged

Compare how each output relates to the ground-truth Reference Output. 
Before comparison, identify which aspects of the ground-truth Reference Output are essential to match given the context of the Instruction. 
Then determine which output demonstrates closer similarity to the ground-truth Reference Output.

You should answer using ONLY "Output (a)" or "Output (b)". Do NOT output any other words.

# Ground-truth Reference Output:
{REFERENCE}

# Instruction:
{INSTRUCTION}

# Output (a):
{OUTPUT_1}

# Output (b):
{OUTPUT_2}

# Which is more similar to the Reference Output, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should ONLY be either "Output (a)" or "Output (b)" verbatim:
