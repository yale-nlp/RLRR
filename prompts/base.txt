Decide which output is better at following the instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.

Here are some aspects to consider:
1. Outputs should precisely follow the instruction. If an output contains unrelated information or does not complete each and all requirements in the instruction, it means that output does not precisely follow the instruction.
2. You should check for factual correctness and accuracy of outputs. If an output contains factual errors (especially with numbers), it should be considered lower quality.
3. Outputs should contain only a brief effective response without any verbose explanation, unless the instruction explicitly asks for an explanation.
4. The order in which the outputs are presented to you should NOT affect your judgment.

Select which output, "Output (a)" or "Output (b)", is better at following the instruction. Your answer should ONLY contain: "Output (a)" or "Output (b)".

# Instruction:
{INSTRUCTION}

# Output (a):
{OUTPUT_1}

# Output (b):
{OUTPUT_2}

# Which is the better, "Output (a)" or "Output (b)"? Your answer should ONLY contain either "Output (a)" or "Output (b)":
